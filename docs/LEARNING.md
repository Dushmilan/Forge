# Learning Log

One entry per version. The point is to record what *I* learned about Go, not
what the code does. Write it after the version's tests are green.

## V0 — Single-process executor

- **Concept:**
  - Named types + `iota` enums, and `fmt.Stringer` (interfaces are satisfied
    *implicitly* — no `implements` keyword).
  - Errors as values: sentinels (`errors.New`), wrapping with `%w`, and
    inspecting with `errors.Is` (sentinels) vs `errors.As` (concrete types).
  - `os/exec` for real subprocesses; distinguishing a start failure from a
    non-zero exit.
  - Implicit interfaces again with `io.Writer`, which is what makes `main`
    testable.
- **What I built:** `internal/job` (Job, Status, Validate), `internal/executor`
  (Executor, Result, Runner seam), and a testable `cmd/forge` entrypoint that
  prints usage, runs one command, and propagates its exit code.
